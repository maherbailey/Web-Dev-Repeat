        <h2>About Education</h2>
        <p>
          Education is a really important aspect in life as it teaches how to do maths, how to write properly.
           It also teaches us the difference between right and wrong and how to think for ourselves.
            the education a person gets can really shape their whole life and completely change their whole life.
            Like what job that person will work and who they will become friends with. Education can also shape
            how we live and the community around us and sometimes even entire nations can be shaped by the education they have.
