        <h2>The Benefits of Education</h2>
        <p>
          Education provides knowledge, skills, and opportunities. It empowers
          people to improve their lives and make positive changes in society. Education can shape lives.
          People who recive a better education than others tend to do more well in life so I think we should
          be striving to make a good education more acceseable to everyone and there should be a higher standard
          when it comes to early life education such as Primary and Secondary School. I personally 
          also think that here in Ireland we should revise and change our points system to get into college
          as it is unfair in the sense that a person could have a really bad day during one of their Leaving Cert
          exams and it could cause them to not do as well as they normally would. I think that exams should be done through
          out the year and a person should be evaluated on that as the Leaving cert in short relies on how good 
          you will do in a one week timeframe which is unfair as I mentioned above a person could go be throughing a horrible
          time in their life and that could affect their preformance. I will also leave a link below about a girl
          who had gotten max points on her Leaving cert but still didn't recive the course she wanted as the university had used a 
          lottery system to decide who got the course. In this case it was unfair as the girl could not have done better and I think
          in cases like this an entrance exam should be used to determin who gets which course. See below at the Bottom of the page for
          more advantages about education.
